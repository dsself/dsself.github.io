## Binding Contestation: How Party-Military Relations Influence Democratization

From setting restrictions on popular sovereignty and open contestation, to yielding
entirely to civilians, there is substantial variation in how militaries behave in transitions
from military rule. I argue that the extent to which a military sets parameters
on electoral and political institutions during a regime transition, what I call bounded
democratization, is a function of a military's confidence that parties will protect the
military's corporate interests following the transition. A military's confidence in political
parties is influenced by the degree of trust between the parties and the military,
the institutionalization of the incumbent party, as well as the electoral and political
strength of the incumbent party. When these factors are high, the military's confidence
increases and it becomes more willing to yield to civilian parties. Using comparative
historical analysis on a paired comparison of Indonesia and Paraguay I test the causal
mechanisms and then use quantitative models to show that the mechanisms are generalizable.
