## Binding Contestation: How Party-Military Relations Influence Democratization

A key dilemma facing a military which is considering democratization is whether it is confident that civilians
will protect its interests. A military's confidence is a function of three factors: preference alignment with parties (trust), an expectation that allied parties will survive the transition
(party institutionalization), and an expectation that allied parties can win power to
protect it (party strength). When parties that the military trusts are institutionalized
and strong, the military is confident that democratization will not endanger
its interests. When these factors are absent, the military seeks to generate credible
commitments through bounded democratization -- a strategy of setting parameters on
open contestation and popular sovereignty to constrain civilians. I test this argument
using an original dataset on 525 regime transitions and a novel measure of bounded
democratization. I find that when the institutionalization and strength of trusted parties
decrease, the military proactively sets constraints on the developing political
system.
