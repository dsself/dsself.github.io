I am a PhD Candidate in the Department of Government at Cornell University. I specialize in Comparative Politics with a minor in International Relations. My committee is comprised of Thomas Pepinsky (chair), Rachel Beatty Riedl, Kenneth Roberts, and Nic van de Walle. My research focuses on authoritarian incubment parties, militaries, party systems, and democratization.  


My dissertation explains why some militaries support democratization. Specifically, I explain why some militaries set parameters on electoral, legislative, or executive institutions. I argue that militaries do this when their confidence in the ability of civilians to secure their core interests under democracy is low. The militaryâ€™s confidence in civilians is higher when the military and civilians share a vision of the national project, and when parties allied with the military are institutionalized and electorally strong. I test this argument using mixed-methods, including archival research and elite interviews conducted in Indonesia and Paraguay, and cross-national quantitative data using an original dataset I have created on military behavior during 150 different regime transitions following military-backed authoritarian rule.

My other research looks at the role of authoritarian incumbent parties and their effects on various aspects of democratic development and consolidation. For example, I have working papers under review on how authoritarian incumbent parties affect democratic party system development globally, as well as how these parties restrain former military officers' political prospects. These papers, along with other papers, can be found in [Working Papers](https://dsself.github.io/workingpapers/). I have begun new projects looking at how militaries affect the formation of competitive authoritarian regimes, how militaries have changed their strategies in constraining civilians over time, and how caretaker military regimes use their power to restructure democracies following coups. 

I have received several awards and fellowships including the Fulbright Fellowship, Henry Luce Foundation Research Grant, Southeast Asian Research Group pre-dissertation Fellowship, Foreign Language and Area Studies Fellowship, and have served as a Cornell Latin American Studies Program fellow.
